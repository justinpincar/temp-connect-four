  <h3 class="title">Hackathon</h3>
  <h4 class="subtitle">...not just for devs!</h4>
  <p>
    On September 21st, mew will be holding its first hackathon at the Yetizen Innovation Loft. The goal is simple: in three hours you'll build the best artificial intelligence you can to compete at a well-known board game (we'll tell you which when you arrive). Small teams of three or four are encouraged to compete. You'll need developers to program how the game will act, but even if you can't program, someone will need to think up and quantify your strategy!
  </p>

  <h3>Cash Prizes</h3>
  <p>
    The top three winning teams of the final tournament will receive cash prizes.
    <ul>
      <li>1st place - $500</li>
      <li>2nd place - $250</li>
      <li>3rd place - $100</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>And then what?</h3>
  <p>
    We're building out a platform for you to compete against anyone on our servers. We'll have a ladder and frequent tournaments. You can track the performance of your bots and test out new strategies. We'll also continue to host hackathons and introduce new games every three months.
